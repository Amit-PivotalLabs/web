  <h3 class="page-header">What is a Release?</h3>

  <p>A release is a versioned collection of configuration properties, configuration templates, start up scripts, source code, binary artifacts, and anything else required to build and deploy software in a reproducible way.</p>

  <p>A release is the layer placed on top of a stemcell. They are self-contained and provide very specific software for the purpose of that release.</p>
